I am an immunologist turned data scientist with a PhD degree form Karolinska Institutet. My [dissertation](https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/handle/10616/46147) focused on the real time monitoring of DNA vaccines by in vivo imaging. Since the completion of my graduate studies I have developed expertise in working big data such as these generated by next-generation sequencing of human genomes.
